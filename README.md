## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mario, but I go by my middle name, Dante. I just graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from Wittenberg University, and I am interested in all things IT! When I am not working or learning about IT, I am lifting weights, watching, or playing football, basketball, and golf.
  
- ðŸ”­ I recently just completed my senior capstone project with two other Computer Science Students - a Password Manager Application using Python, check it out [here](https://github.com/MarioDanteGetawJr/Senior-Capstone---Password-Manager)
- ðŸŒ± I have recently completed an assortment of Machine Learning projects using Python, check them out [here](https://github.com/MarioDanteGetawJr/Machine-Learning-Projects)
- âš¡ I am currently searching for a job in the IT field back home in the Detroit area (or remote work)
