## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mario, but I go by my middle name, Dante, and I am a soon to be Computer Science graduate from Wittenberg University interested in all things IT! When I am not working or learning about IT, I can be found watching or playing football, basketball, and golf.
  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a password manager application with two other senior Computer Science students at my school, check out the current progress [here](https://github.com/MarioDanteGetawJr/Senior-Capstone---Password-Manager)
- ðŸŒ± I have recently completed an assortment of Machine Learning projects using Python, check them out [here](https://github.com/MarioDanteGetawJr/Machine-Learning-Projects)
- âš¡ I am currently searching for a job in the IT field back home in the Detroit area
