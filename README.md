## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mario, but I go by my middle name, Dante. I am a recent Computer Science graduate from Wittenberg University, and I am interested in all things IT! Currently, I am a Helpdesk Technician for TEKsystems. When I am not working or learning about IT, I am lifting weights, watching, or playing football, basketball, and golf.

- âš¡ Currently, I am using Windows Server 2022 on VMware to build Active Directory in a virtual environment, and practice doing things like creating users, groups, access control requests, OU organization, imaging, scripting, remote login, GPO setup and misfires, and more! Check out the progress [here](https://github.com/MarioDanteGetawJr/IT-Helpdesk-Level-1-Lab) 
- ðŸ”­ I recently just completed my senior capstone project with two other Computer Science Students - a Password Manager Application using Python, check it out [here](https://github.com/MarioDanteGetawJr/Senior-Capstone---Password-Manager)
- ðŸŒ± I have completed an assortment of Machine Learning projects using Python, check them out [here](https://github.com/MarioDanteGetawJr/Machine-Learning-Projects)
- ðŸ‘¯ I am currently searching for a job in the IT field back home in the Detroit area (or remote work)
